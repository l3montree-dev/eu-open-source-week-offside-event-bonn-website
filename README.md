# Cybersecurity Hackathon
Welcome to the EU Open Source Week - Offside Event Bonn official repository! This Event brings together cybersecurity enthusiasts, developers, and experts to connect about some of the most pressing challenges in the field. The event encourages collaboration, innovation, and the development of cutting-edge solutions to enhance cybersecurity practices and technologies.

## Overview
Is Open Source Crucial for the Future of Technology? How can we as a community tackle security, policy, and business models and shape the evolution of OSS.
Open source is no longer just a development philosophy; it is at the heart of global technological advancements. However, as the adoption of open source continues to grow, so too do the challenges related to security, governance, and its integration into business operations. In this session, we will address:

- ### Open Source Security: 
  How can we ensure that open source projects remain secure in an increasingly complex and hostile digital landscape? What are the tools, strategies, and best practices for managing open source security risks?

- ### Open Source Policies: 
  What role do policymakers play in shaping the future of open source in Europe and globally? How can governments and institutions foster an ecosystem that promotes innovation while safeguarding public and private interests?

- ### Open Source as a Business Model: 
  Open source is no longer just a tech movement; it’s a sustainable business model for many organizations. We’ll explore successful open source business strategies, monetization models, and how companies can build and maintain thriving businesses around open source.

Join us for this dynamic session where we’ll not only highlight the latest challenges and opportunities but also pave the way for collaboration across sectors to drive the future of open source forward with confidence and security. Whether you’re a developer, policymaker, business leader, or open source enthusiast, this is an event you won’t want to miss.



We look forward to an engaging and thought-provoking discussion in Bonn as part of the EU Open Source Week!
